Ogar Unlimited is designed to be used with the latest Agar.io client. It is basically what it says in the title, Ogar, except its functionality is unlimited!\r\n\r\nThis Modified copy was created to help those who want to open their server to the public. I will add more features as time goes\r\n\r\n(Sorry but all client clones of agar.io are ILLEGAL, thus we are not making those. You must use `agar.io/?ip=[ip]`)\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE: FOR THOSE WHO CANT USE THE INSTALL DEPENDANCIES SCRIPT, YOU MUST DO NPM INSTALL AFTER YOU CD INTO THE SRC FOLDER**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highlight features in this modified copy\r\n 1. PMSG command, to periodically send a message (no need for admin to be online to explain rules)\r\n 2. OP , to do stuff in game WITHOUT a illegal clone client, see below\r\n 3. MSG, FMSG commands\r\n 4. Max IP Connections\r\n 5. Troll command ;)\r\n 6. More GameModes\r\n 7. Ban, Unban, Ban List (with revolutionary ban technique, no lag, no DDoS attacks)\r\n 8. Autoban option (see config.ini or advconfig.ini)\r\n 9. More control (config.ini and advconfig.ini)\r\n 10. and other features such as merge or nojoin or kick/killrange\r\n 11. Better physics (ejected mass and split and virus)\r\n 12. Colortext command (Changes console output color and style)\r\n 13. Live Console (see gameserver.ini, where a live console appears) NOTE: this is way different that Ogarserv's Console\r\n 14. Restart. Make it restart automatically or restart manually, Only works if use windows start script\r\n 15. skins, to use custom skins, do <skinname> and then your name. for example `<spy> lol` will give you spy skin with name of lol use `[website]` to use a custom skin from a website (you need to use a url shortener though)\r\n 16. customskins (see custom skins)\r\n 17. Minions: you can create minions like agario powerups. press q to enter minion control mode (a b will appear next to your name). w = eject, space = split. press q again to exit\r\n 18. Banlist file\r\n 19. Opbyip\r\n 20. Database free high score keeper\r\n 21. pcmd command to do periodic commands\r\n 22. range command for bulk commands\r\n 23. easy verify system as anti bot mesure (config.ini or advconfig.ini)\r\n 24. mousefilter as a anti bot measure\r\n 25. plugins. Add gamemodes and commands easily! (See example plugin and template plugin)\r\n \r\n### Note:\r\nPlease note that this is updated very frequently and you should check for updates every week. I added an update system but It needs to be initialized by you (because I don't think it is the right thing to do, updating without your consent). Also you may copy this and modify it just please give some credit to the hard working dev team, that is all I care. Another note is that I am sometimes terrible in my grammar (I still cannot spell potato out loud). If there is an issue, please notify me. If there is something you want in this, just make a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Purchased Ogar UL?\r\nIf you've purchased a copy of Ogar UL, you just got scammed. It is open source which means it is FREE. yes FREE! So if you paid any money, well, too bad\r\n\r\n### How do I use these plugins?\r\n\r\nTo use a plugin, simply download the folder and drag it into the plugins folder in src or use the plugin add command. To use the plugin add command, the plugin must have a files.txt file. then click on that file, click raw, and then copy the url. Then do `plugin add [url] [pluginname]` and it will even reload automatically for you. Thats it! example, doing `plugin add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJS-development/OgarUL-Plugin-Library/master/devtools-plugin/files.txt devtools` will add a plugin called devtools to your plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Plugin Library:\r\nhttps://github.com/AJS-development/OgarUL-Plugin-Library\r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I create a plugin? Is there Documentation?\r\n\r\nThis is the fun part, creating your own plugins. There is an example plugin you should look at and there is a template plugin. Currently, there is no documentation, but will be soon in the wiki\r\n\r\n### Easy Verify\r\nFor those of you who have trouble with minions and such, this feature is for you. Currently, there is no program that can get through all of ogar unlimited's filterrs anddd features, but in some future, someone might be able to crack the other anti bot mesures. So we created easy verify, a currently foolproof system that filters out bots. To turn on, turn verify to 1 in config. Then when a player spawns, he is frozen at a spot and is given a 3 digit code. Then that player presses w to kill himself and types in the code in the nickname box. Afteword, when pressing play again, it shows a success message. Press w again to play.\r\n\r\n### Minions\r\nYou use minions by doing `minion [yourid] [amount] [minionname]`. Then, they will start following your mouse. You can control those minions by useing the q key. If you press it, a B will appear next to your name. then controls will be normal except now ejecting and splitting will happen on your minions not you. you can reenter normal control mode by pressing q again. You can disable minions by doing `minion [id]` in console for just you or do `minion destroy` and it will remove all minions.\r\n\r\n### OP(2.4.5) - Guide,\r\nYou use OP by first setting who has op by doing op [id] in console. Then, that player can use the op features in game by pressing q. Then a c will appear next to your name. If you press w in this state, it gives you 100 more mass. If you press space in this state, you will be able to rejoin instantly. You will find out that if you press q again, two c's will appear next to your name. if you press w in this state, you shoot viruses. If you press space in this state, you shoot tiny things (almost invisible) that if someone eats, their mass is reduced by 100. Then, if you press q again,3 c's will appear.press w with 3c's, you shoot a virus, but whoever who eats it will be trolled :). If you press space with 3 c's the person who eats the virus will explode.If you  press q again, 4 cs will appear and if you press w, you will shoot a virus tha kills people and space, it shoots a kick virus. You can then exit op by pressing q again after doing an action or by pressing Q until the three c's will dissappear (so that you can normally split and shoot mass).\r\n\r\n* Note: names (CC's) dont work when player name is blank and it doesnt work on Virus and Leap gamemodes\r\n\r\n## Custom skins (guide)\r\nYou can use custom skins by putting them in customskins.txt\r\nthe format is `[shortcut] [skin]` for the skin field, to use a URL skin, you do `:http://url` DO NOT FORGET TO GET REID OF THE S IF IT IS HTTPS OR FORGET TO PUT A : BEFORE.To use an agario skin, use `%skinname`To use that skin in game simply do `<skinsshortuct>` and then your name,\r\n\r\nYou can see a more detailed guide on the [wiki] (https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited/wiki/Skins-and-skin-shortcuts)\r\n\r\n## Obtaining and Using\r\n\r\nAs Ogar Unlimited is written in Node.js, you must have Node.js and its \"ws\", and \"request\" module installed to use it (unless you are using the Windows binary). You can usually download Node using your distribution's package manager (for *nix-like systems), or from [the Node website](http://nodejs.org). To install the \"ws\" and \"request\" module that is required, open up your system command line (cmd for windows, terminal for mac) and type \"npm install ws\" and do \"npm install request\". To see a detailed guide go to the [Installation guide] (https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited/wiki/Installation) in the wiki\r\n\r\n(You can install and use Ogar unlimited on windows very quickly. First click `InstallWebSocket.bat` in src. Then wait (it takes a while), then click `Start.bat` and you're off! The next time you start the server, you only have to click `Start.bat`)\r\n\r\n(Binarys are also available in Releases)\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ogar listens on the following addresses and ports:\r\n* *:88 - for the stats server (I would use it to track servers)\r\n* *:443 - for the game server\r\n\r\nPlease note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports. **If you are getting an EADDRINUSE error, it means that the port required to run Ogar is being used. Usually, Skype is the culprit. To solve this, either close out skype, or change the serverPort value in gameserver.ini to a different port. You will have to change your connection ip to \"127.0.0.1:PORT\"**\r\n\r\nOnce the game server is running, you can connect (locally) by typing `agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:443` into your browser's address bar.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Ogar\r\nUse \"gameserver.ini\" to modify Ogar's configurations field. Player bots are currently basic and for testing purposes. To use them, change \"serverBots\" to a value higher than zero in the configuration file. To add/remove bot names, edit the file named \"botnames.txt\" which is in the same folder as \"gameserver.ini\". Names should be separated by using the enter key.\r\n\r\n## Custom Game modes\r\nOgar has support for custom game modes. To switch between game modes, change the value of \"serverGamemode\" in the configurations file to the selected game mode id and restart the server. The current supported game modes are:\r\n\r\nId   | Name\r\n-----|--------------\r\n0    | Free For All\r\n1    | Teams\r\n2    | Experimental (As of 6/13/15)\r\n8    | Experimental v2\r\n3    | Timed FFA\r\n4    | Virus Off (no virus's)\r\n7    | Shrinking FFA, Shrinks the game as time passes\r\n10   | Tournament\r\n11   | Hunger Games\r\n12   | Zombie Mode\r\n13   | Team Z\r\n14   | Team X\r\n20   | Rainbow FFA - Hint: Use with \"setAcid(true)\" ( Use this in your Google Console)\r\n5    | UnlimitPVP - where you split can split indefinitly and rejoin instantly - 1v1 game (created by me)\r\n6    | UnlimitFFA - same as above (unlimited pvp) except in ffa (created by me)\r\n15   | NoCollision Teams\r\n16   | NoCollision TeamZ\r\n17   | NoCollision TeamX\r\n18   | Leap - Where you leap instead of split, made by Ogarplus\r\n22   | BlackHole\r\n\r\n## Console Commands\r\nThe current available console commands are listed here.
